# Reinforcement-Learning-Pacman

This a open-source project done by Xiaoquan Ji (Harrison). Pacman is a well-known game since last century. 
This project includes a pacman game for human player, a AI controlled pacman game using path-finding algorithm, and an AI controlled pacman game trained by Reinforcement Learning.


This README file includes:
* Video of this profect
* Performance data of Reinforcement Learning
* Explanation of the source code

Videos
======
The first video shows the AI before training. Pacman is randomly exploring.

The second video shows the AI after training. Pacman is eating dots as fast as possible while keeping awway from the ghosts.


Reinforcement Learning Performance
=================================
The first figure shows the total rewards gaied in each game. Pacman can get more rewards as the training process goes. After 18 games, it can mantain a reward between 300 and 400 each game.

The second figuer shows the rewards gained during a single game. Pacman is cumulating ots reward as quick as possible.


How to run
==========
To run game for human player
```
Run Pacman.java
```
To run pacman with Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm
```
Run PacmanDijkstra.java
```
To run Reinforcement Learning AI
```
Run PAcmanRL.java
```
Parameters for training such as learning factor, decay rate. radom rate can be set in
```
ReinforcementLearning/Qlearning.java
```
To train from start, set the following
```
train = true
keepTrain = false
readQ = false
```
To continue training from exsisting model, set
```
train = true
keepTrain = true
readQ = false
```
To load a traned model, set
```
train = false
keepTrain = false
readQ = true
```
